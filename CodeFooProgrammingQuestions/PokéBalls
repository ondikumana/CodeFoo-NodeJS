I play any game but Pokemon Go. So my answer to this question is extremly poor.

The team would find resources to help understand the game, then would use https://www.ign.com/videos/2013/10/12/pokemon-x-and-y-walkthrough-route-7-waking-up-snorlax as a guide.
They would walk away with as many Pok√© Balls available.
